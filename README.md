## Adding new features

I will post a well detailed version in the future for how to add if you want to trigger another command. Here is a short brief. You need to write it in pyClasses.py.
You have to call your new feature's function(You just did in pyClasses.py) in app.py under the other commands such as /lockdown . 
Now you have to write a Javascript script for calling the function on the server side.
